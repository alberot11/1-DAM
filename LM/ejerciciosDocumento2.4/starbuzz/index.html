    <h2>House Blend, $1.49</h2>
    <p>
        Itâ€™s deceptively simple. A blend of fine Latin American beans 
        roasted to a glistening, dark chestnut color. Loaded with 
        flavor, balancing tastes of nut and cocoa, just a touch of 
        sweetness from the roast.
    </p>
    <h2>Mocha Cafe Latte, $2.35</h2>
    <p>
        Any one of the above espresso + milk drinks with chocolate 
        added.
    </p>
    <h2>Cappuccino, $1.89</h2>
    <p>
        A mixture espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. The milk is 
        steamed through a special high pressure steam pipe on the 
        espresso machine.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chai">Chai Tea, $1.85</h2>
    <p>
        A spicy drink made with black tea, spices, milk and honey.
